The earthquake? It was terrible. I never expected that. I physically hurt from it, my heart hurts. Bricks were falling, it was scary. I ran to an open space. I still have dead bodies in my head. Still. It was so scary. I couldn’t go to the office, so I just helped where I could. I am trained in basic first aid, so I helped to give first aid to people. I have done many search and rescue trainings, basic first aid trainings, but this was different.</p> <p>I cannot leave Red Cross. This is such impressive work. It all comes down to the seven principles. To the principle of humanity. I cannot go back.</p> <p>I am proud of this work. It’s good to say I’m working for humanity.</p> <p>Two or three hours after the earthquake, I decided I needed to do something so I walked to Bhaktapur. I saw all the roads were collapsed, security forces everywhere. I felt like I had some sort of power, and that my power is that I am Red Cross. I felt it.</p><p>After 15 or 16 days of working nonstop, it all caught up with me. I cried and cried and cried.</p>"

I have been doing registration at the health clinic for the past week. I lost both of my homes in the earthquakes. My father rented one closer to the market where our shop was and we had another one further in the mountains. After the first earthquake, we lost one. After the second earthquake, we lost the other. We lost our shop too, our source of income. The market is down now; there are not so many people anymore. It used to be lively.</p> <p>The Red Cross brought us food, some rice and dal, after the earthquake, and I learned about the health clinic. I asked for a job and now I register people when they come into the clinic. There are 27 villages around the health clinic that people are coming from. They travel between four and eleven hours to get here. Red Cross is well known so people know to go here for help.</p> <p>My family—my mother, father and younger brother—are now living in a tent until after monsoon season and then we will rebuild.</p>"

He draws it in crayon, sometimes in pen, but always the same thing. He is 12 years old and he lost his mother in the earthquake. He father left him, unable to cope. I’m not quite sure what it means yet, but his drawings really touch me. This is not a simple picture. I think he is trying to find ways to remember his mother. It is quite a traumatic experience for someone so young to go through.</p> <p>I also had a patient that was a 4 year-old boy. He lost a third of his weight in less than a month. He had been buried in the rubble after the earthquake. His grandmother was concerned. He wouldn’t eat, even sweets. After seeing him a couple of times, he beganweb to open up to others and started eating again.</p><p>His grandmother tried to tell me ‘thank you’ in Nepali. I couldn’t understand her words but in her eyes it was clear.</p> <p>I worked in Liberia before this. There are similarities to the situation people faced with Ebola. Both experiences are incredibly stressful.</p> <p>One thing I have heard both here and there, over and over is, ‘I don’t believe this is real’. One mother in Melamchi told me, ‘One moment I am feeding my child and 30 seconds later, he is dead in my arms.’ She goes feels the same trauma every morning when she wakes up.</p> <p>Without mental health services, you can give someone food but you can’t give them an appetite. You can give them shelter, but not a home. You can give them materials to rebuild their homes, but not to rebuild their lives. You can give them a blanket, but not sleep.</p>"
farzana-akther,Sindhuli,27.2525091,85.930622,Farzana Akther,Regional Disaster Response Team,Bangladesh Red Crescent Society,null,null,"<p>Normally I work in human resources in the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, but since 2009 I have trained to help people in need. The training has taken me to Nepal and Sri Lanka. But the Nepal earthquake is my chance to put my skills into action.</p> <p>I feel pride as a female Regional Disaster Response Team member. I’m grateful that the Red Cross Red Crescent used me in the Nepal operation. I can cope with this work. I can make a humanitarian contribution from the heart. I love the Red Cross Red Crescent because everyone works for humanitarian impacts. And I love the seven fundamental principles and I honour them.</p> <p>I have been involved with distributing relief to people affected by the earthquakes, and water and sanitation activities.</p> <p>Coming from the same part of the world gives me a greater insight. I noticed some pregnant or breastfeeding women came to relief distributions with their ID cards but did not receive any help. They were not on the list of people entitled to aid.</p> <p>I feel for them. They’re vulnerable, really. If they’re vulnerable we should do something for them. I talked to my team leader about including them in the next round of distributions.</p> <p>My mother-in-law is afraid for me because Nepal is still prone to earthquakes but she encouraged me.</p> <p>My husband said, ‘If you feel it will be helpful for your profession, you can go. It’s up to you.’</p> <p>I said, ‘Don’t you worry that if an earthquake happened I could die?’</p> <p>He said, ‘If Allah has written your death to be in Nepal, you will die there’.</p> <p>If my family didn’t support me, I couldn’t be here.</p> <p>This is a sacrifice from the heart. Our religion says if you do something good during Ramadan/Ramzan, it will be increased. It will be doubled. The main thing is to do things for humanitarian reasons.</p>"
sumana-dawdi,"Balaju, Kathmandu",27.7356252,85.2879177,Sumana Dawadi,Volunteer,Nepal Red Cross,null,null,"<p>I started volunteering with Red Cross in 2007, when I was 16. My sister and my aunt were both Red Cross volunteers and I was so impressed. I took a basic first aid training, all kinds of training. You have to have a will to be a volunteer, a will to help other people.</p> <p>There was a prediction of earthquakes in all my training, so I use to talk about earthquakes all the time. I always told people they needed to be prepared. I learned that when you’re a volunteer you can volunteer from the place you are, serving people around your home. That inspired me.</p> <p>After the earthquake, I thought I am alive, so I went to volunteer, handing out water and helping with first aid. My nephew and I walked for three hours that day, and I was still in my slippers. We dug people out of the rubble. I am also a nurse, so I helped where I could. The house just opposite of ours was destroyed. There was no network, no power, no phone, internet or electricity. We couldn’t find out about our family in Gorkha, we didn’t know if everyone was okay. I cried a lot that day.</p> <p>I went to check on my friend who lived near me. His apartment building was completely collapsed, eight floors. Two days before we had talked like we never had before, for nearly 1.5 hours. I tried to convince myself that he wasn’t home at the time of the earthquake. After Haiti, they found lots of people 3 or 4 days later. But they still haven’t found my friend’s body.</p> <p>When I went back to my family’s village in Gorkha, it looked like the beginning of time. No homes, just people. I slept in a goat shed. The heat was strong in the day and the rain was strong at night. We rotated positions so that not everyone had to sleep in the rain, but we all still got wet.</p><p>It was something out of my imagination. There was nothing there. Everything was gone. I couldn’t cry, I couldn’t laugh. Because this was happening everywhere.</p> <p>I use to live with my grandmother. We were very close. She died at 102 and had 17 children. She taught me to be confident. She was not educated but she was the most intellectual person I knew. She was my biggest inspiration. Red Cross is my second.</p><p>When I wear the Red Cross as a volunteer, I am proud. People treat you differently. I always people are thinking good things about me when they see I am a volunteer. </p>"
johnnes-schad,"Singati, Dolakha",27.7361686,86.163925,Dr. Johnnes Schad,Team Leader,German/Finnish/French Red Cross Basic Health Care Unit,null,null,"<p>I have worked for the Red Cross for 20 years. I have worked in Haiti, Iraq, the Gaza Strip, the Philippines and I was most recently in Liberia. Personally, it is impressive how much the Red Cross movement is able to work in very different areas and contexts and still make such a good contribution to the people.</p> <p>People have a romantic view of Nepal, but it is very hard to work here. I am in Singati, a remote area in the Dolakha district and accessibility is very tricky here. The Nepal Red Cross and the Ministry of Health requested support for the operation here and in response we are running a basic health care unit. We see about 70 patients a day.</p>  <p>The day before I arrived, a woman who had suffered a miscarriage was brought in to the clinic. A rotation of family members carried her in a basket on their backs for 11 hours to get here.  And situations like this are common. It is unreal, just completely unreal.</p> <p>Nepal is very difficult logistics-wise. Because of the high mountains, it is difficult to get here, difficult for patients. They need a couple of hours to get here. Communications are difficult too, and it’s important we are getting information to the villages. We rely a lot on the Nepal Red Cross and the Ministry of Health. It’s a really important relationship to know the needs of our beneficiaries.</p> <p>The monsoon season has started so we have heavy rains and this causes challenges too. It’s breathtaking to see how people have gotten here, walking so far and carrying their family members on their backs. They are very appreciative because otherwise, they would have to go to Kathmandu, which is unreachable for many parts of the population. There are a lot of patients and it’s an ongoing challenge to see all of them.</p> "
graeme-brown,"Chautara, Sindhupalchok",27.761329,85.803222,Graeme Brown,"Emergency Management Advisor, Logistics and Procurement",New Zealand Red Cross,null,null,"<p>My job is to help set up systems to receive and distribute relief goods like tarpaulins, blankets, kitchen equipment and tools to make shelters.</p> <p>Any disaster operation is complex. Just two months after the worst earthquakes in 80 years, Nepal had the added complications of monsoon rains that loosen soil and bring down landslides onto roads, cutting off people in tiny hamlets perched on mountainsides.</p> <p>I spent two weeks in Chautara, a town northeast of Kathmandu that was very badly affected by the second earthquake on 12 May.</p> <p>A flexible attitude helps in a disaster. Someone says the truck will be here in half an hour. It could be anything from five minutes to five hours.</p> <p>Plans always change. There’s nothing unusual about that. You’ve got to go with the flow and keep smiling. You just smile and change the plan and do something else.</p> <p>I’ve helped with the Queensland floods, the Pike River mining tragedy and the Canterbury earthquakes. I’m glad to have had the chance to join the massive Red Cross effort in Nepal.</p> <p>It’s what I enjoy – going to places and helping, whatever needs to be done.</p>"
